yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away 
now it looks as though they're here to stay
oh I believe in yesterday
suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
there's a shadow hanging over me 
oh yesterday came suddenly
why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong now I long for yesterday
yesterday love was such as easy game to play
now I need a place to hide away
oh I believe in yesterday
well she was just seventeen
you know what I mean
and the way she looked
was way beyond compare
so how could I dance with another
when I saw her standing there
well she looked at me
and I could see
that before too long 
I'd fall in love with her
she wouldn't dance with another
when I saw her standing there
well my heart went boom
when I crossed that room
and I held her hand in mine
we danced through the night
and we held each other tight
and before too long
I fell in love with her
now I'll never dance with another
since I saw her standing there
close your eyes and I'll kiss you
tomorrow I'll miss you
remember I'll always be true
and then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
and I'll send all my loving to you
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
the lips I am missing
and hope that my dreams will come true
and then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
and I'll send all my loving to you
all my loving I will send to you
all my loving darling I'll be true
ooh I need your love babe
guess you know it's true
hope you need my love babe

when I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
but now these days are gone I'm not so self assured
now I find I've changed my mind I opened up the doors
help me if you can I'm feeling down
and I do appreciate you being 'round
help me get my feet back up the ground
won't you please please help me
and now my life has change in oh so many ways
my independence seems to vanish in the haze
but every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
it's been a hard day's night and I'd been working like a dog
it's been a hard day's night I should be sleeping like a log
but when I get home to you I find the things that you do
will make me feel alright
you know I work all day to get you money to buy you things
and it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
so why on earth should I moan cause when I get you alone 
you know I feel okay
when I'm home everything seems to be right
when I'm home feeling you holding me tight tight yeah
oh yeah I'll tell you something
I think you'll understand
when I'll say that something
I wanna hold your hand
oh please say to me
you'll let be your man
and please say to me

I wanna hold your hand
and when I touch you I feel happy inside
it's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide
I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today yeah
the girl that's driving me mad
is going away
she's got a ticket to ride
but she don't care
she said that living with me
is bringing her down yeah
for she would never be free
while I was around
I don't know why she's riding so high
she ought to think twice
she ought to do right by me
before she gets to saying goodbye
she ought to think twice
she ought to do right by me
my baby don't care
hey Jude don't make it bad
take a sad song and make it better
remember to let her into your heart
then you can start to make it better
hey Jue don't be afraid
you were made to go out and get her
the minute you let her under your skin
then you begin to make it better
and anytime you feel the pain hey Jude refrain
don't carry the world upon your shoulder

by making his world a little colder
nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
hey Jude don't let me down
you have found her now go and get her
remember to let her into your heart
then you can start to make it better
so let it out and let in hey Jude begin
you're waiting for someone to perform with
and don't you know that it's just you hey Jude you'll do
the movement you need is on your shoulder
better better better better better better
when I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
speaking words of wisdom let it be
and in my hour of darkness
she is standing right in front of me
speaking words of wisdom let it be
and when the broken hearted people
living in the world agree
there will be an answer let it be
for though they may be parted
there is still a chance that they will see
there will be an answer let it be
and when the night is cloudy
there is still a light that shines on me
shine until tomorrow let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
speaking words of wisdom let it be
the long and winding road that leads to your door
will never disappear
I've seen that road before it always leads me here

the wild and windy night that the rain washed away
has left a pool of tears crying for the day

many times I've been alone and many times I've cried
anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried
and still they lead me back to the long winding road
you left me standing here a long long time ago
don't leave me waiting here lead me to your door
don't keep me waiting here lead me to your door

in the town where I was born
lived a man who sailed to sea
and he told us of his life
in the land of submarines
so we sailed up to the sun
till we found the sea of green
and we lived beneath the waves
in our yellow submarine
we all live in a yellow submarine
yellow submarine yellow submarine
and our friends are all on board
many more of them live next door
and the band begins to play
as we live a life of ease
everyone of us has all we need
sky of blue and sea of green
in our yellow submarine
ah look at all the lonely people
ah look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
lives in a dream
waits at the window wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door
who is it for
all the lonely people
where do they all come from
all the lonely people
where do they all belong
Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
no one comes near
look at him working darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
what does he care
Eleanor Rigby dies in the church and was buried along with her name
nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
no one was saved
in Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
of every head he's had the pleasure to know
and all the people that come and go
stop and say hello
on the corner is a banker with a motorcar
the little children laugh at him behind his back
and the banker never wears a mac
in the pouring rain very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
there beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
in Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
and his pocket is a portrait of the queen
he likes to keep his fire engine clean
it's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
a four of fish and finger pies
in summer meanwhile back
in Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
we see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
and then the fireman rushes in
from the pouring rain very strange
love love love
there's nothing you can do that can't be done
nothing you can sing that can't be sung
nothing you can say but can learn how to play the game
it's easy
nothing you can make that can't be made
no one you can save that can't be saved
nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
it's easy
all you need is love
all you need is love love
love is all you need
nothing you can know that isn't known
nothing you can see that isn't shown
nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
it's easy
you say yes I say no
you say stop and I say go go go oh no
you say goodbye and I say hello
hello hello
I don't know why you say goodbye I say hello
I say high you say low
you say why and I say I don't know oh no
you say goodbye and I say hello
I don't know why you say goodbye I say hello
Lady Madonna children at your feet
wonder how you manage to make ends meet
who finds the money when you pay the rent
did you think the money was heaven sent
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creep in like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
see how they run
Lady Madonna baby at your breast
wonder how you manage to feed the rest
see how they run
Lady Madonna lying on the bed
listen to the music playing in your head
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
see how they run
standing in the dock at Southampton
trying to get to Holland or France
the man in the mac said you've got to turn back
you know they didn't even give us a chance
Christ you know it ain't easy
you know how hard it can be
the way things are going
they're going to crucify me
finally made the plane into Paris
honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
you can make it okay
you can get married in Gibraltar near Spain
drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
talking in our beds for a week
the newspapers said say what you doing in bed
I said we're only trying to get us some peace
saving up you money for a rainy day
giving all your clothes to charity
last night the wife said
oh boy when you're dead
you don't take nothing with you
but your soul 
think
made a lightning trip to Vienna
eating chocolate cake in a bag
the newspapers said she's gone to his head
they look just like two gurus in drag
caught an early plane to London
fifty acorns tied in a sack
the man from the press said we wish you success
it's good to have the both of you back
something in the way she moves
attracts me like no other lover
something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
you know I believe and how
somewhere in her smile she knows
that I don't need no other lover
something in her style that shows me
you're asking me will my love grow
I don't know I don't know
you stick around and it may show
I don't know I don't know
something in the way she knows
and all I have to do is think of her
something in the things she shows me
don't want to leave her now
you know I believe and how
